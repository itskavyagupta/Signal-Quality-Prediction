**Project Title:** Signal Quality Prediction for Communication Equipment

**Project Description:** 
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to predict the signal quality of communication equipment for a manufacturing company. The company's product emits informative signals, and there is a need to accurately predict the quality of these signals using various parameters. Leveraging techniques from the "Deep Learning for AI" course, this project involves extensive exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing to understand the underlying patterns in the data. Subsequently, a neural network model is designed, trained, and fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance in predicting signal quality. The project not only aims to provide accurate predictions but also to enhance the company's understanding of the factors influencing signal quality in their equipment. Skills and tools covered include exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and the design, training, and tuning of neural network models. This project serves as a practical application of deep learning techniques in a real-world scenario, contributing to advancements in signal quality prediction for communication equipment.
